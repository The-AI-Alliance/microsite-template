# How to Use `microsite-template`

This repo is used as a template to create and publish AI Alliance &ldquo;microsites&rdquo;. It is setup as a GitHub _template repo_, which you can use to create a new repo. Even if you aren't creating a microsite, you can use this procedure to create a new AI Alliance repo for other purposes. Just delete the `docs` directory after creating the repo and skip the steps that don't apply to you.

This file is replaced with the content from `README-template.md` (after some modifications...) when the repo is cloned to create a new repo. So, the instructions for the additional steps you should do when using this template repo are in [`README-instructions.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/microsite-template/blob/main/README-instructions.md).
