## How to Contribute to this Project

We follow normal _GitOps_ practices. Contribute your work (code and docs) as a pull request where it will be go through the usual build and validation, review, etc. If you are new to _GitOps_ practices, see our community [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#processes-for-contributing-to-existing-projects) for an explanation.

There are additional requirements that may be new to you:

* We use _DCO_, discussed [next](#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco).
* We ask you to help us avoid "AI Slop".

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1][DCO] process is used by [the Linux Kernel community][Linux-DCO] and many other major open-source projects, including all AI Alliance projects. 

The DCO is your way of affirming to us that your contribution is legally yours to contribute, but it does not require you to give away ownership of the contribution - your IP remains yours and others' IP remains theirs.

We ask that all your commits include a sign-off statement in the commit message. Here is an example `Signed-off-by` line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```text
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Fortunately, this is easy to do automatically; just use the `-s` flag in your `git commit` commands, as in the following example:

```shell
git commit -s -m 'bug fix' ...
```

> **Tips:** 
>
> * If a commit is created that did not include the `-s` option, the original commit message can be edited by using the `git commit --amend --no-edit -s` command. Then do a "force push" to add the amended commit to a PR. See this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13043357/git-sign-off-previous-commits) for more information.
> * Since it is easy to forget to use the `-s` flag every time, create a git _alias_ that permanently adds the `-s` flag to all commits. For example, here is how to define and use a _global_ alias, `cs`, for this purpose:
> 
> ```shell
> git config --global alias.cs "commit -s"
> ...
> git cs -m 'bug fix' ...
> ```
> 
> The alias will be added to your `~/.gitconfig` file.

If you don't want to make this a global alias, omit `--global` and run the `git config` command in the root directory for your local copy of the `REPO_NAME_MACRO` repo. The alias will be added to the `.git/config` file.

### Avoiding "AI Slop"

Make sure you and your coding agent do the following:

1. Read our general [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME_MACRO/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Making Contributions](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME_MACRO#making-contributions) section of the [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME_MACRO).
2. Follow our [DCO requirement](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME_MACRO/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco) for all code commits.
3. Remove the AI slop in Python and other source files.
4. When creating a pull request (PR), do not quote the whole content of the PR in its description.
5. Make sure you run `make before-pr` locally and that it passes successfully. (Some steps may modify your code. Be sure to commit those modifications, too.)
