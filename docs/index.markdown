A _generic_ quote:

> Shakespeare once wrote, "Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

This site is organized into the following sections [^1] (with an example footnote):

* [TODO - second top-level page]({{site.baseurl}}/second_page)
    * [alternative link](second_page)
* [TODO - nested]({{site.baseurl}}/nested/)

Note how relative links are written. For siblings (like the next set of bullets...) or subpages, you don't have to use the `{{site.baseurl}}` prefix (like the `alternative link`), but use `{{site.baseurl}}` instead of relative navigation hacks like `../../foo/bar`.

## Section Two

A Python code block:

```python
def flibulate_the_ganzinator(how_much):
  pass
```

* [About Us]({{site.baseurl}}/about): More about the AI Alliance and this project.

* [Project GitHub Repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME){:target="repo"}

Note our convention that external URLs include a target, specified with `{:target="some_name"}`. Adding these targets means browsers will automatically open external links in a new tab. You will also notice that external links get a little box and arrow adornment. This is done automatically through a clever CSS hack in `docs/_includes/css/custom.scss.liquid`.

A table example using standard Markdown and showing how to set the desired alignment. (The extra whitespace in the source is only for easier readability.):

| Column 1 (Left Aligned) | Column 2 (Centered) | Column 3 (Numbers - Right Aligned) |
| :------- | :------------------: | -----: |
| text 1   | centered             | 1      |
| text 2   | also centered        | 20     |
| text 3   | and this is centered | 300    |

[^1]: Use `[^N]` (for increasing `N` values) to mark "footnote #N" in text, as shown above. This is an example footnote with a link to it from above, and a link at the end of the footnote to go back to the point in the text (the "curled" arrow). **WARNING**, you must include the colon in the footnote definition as shown here, `[^1]:`.
[^2]: A second example footnote. Note that you don't need to put a blank line between them; they work like lists.

<!-- 
Use the following construct anywhere in the page to automatically
show a table of contents for the sections on the page. This is 
_different_ than a list of child pages (i.e., separate markdown files).
That list is always shown at the bottom automatically, as defined in
the default.html template file.
