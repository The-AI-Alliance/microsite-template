An example of how to use a _relative_ redirect, i.e., within the same site.
The `redirect` template is `docs/_layouts/redirect.html`.
Experiment with the definition for `redirect_rel_url` to make sure it works!
See also `docs/_layouts/abs_redirect.html` for _absolute_ redirects to a
different web site.
