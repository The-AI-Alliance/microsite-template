# In what follows, note the structure used for common tasks, like running the unit tests:
#   unit-tests:: unit-tests-prerequisite unit-tests-default unit-tests-postrequisite
# The *-prerequisite and *-postrequisite are hooks that permit a Makefile to APPEND
# additional dependencies or recipes to execute before or after the "core" command is
# run by *-default. You use the double-colon syntax, "::", for additional *-prerequisite
# and *-postrequisite definitions:
#   unit-tests-prerequisite:: even-more
#   even-more::
#     @echo "Even more stuff!"
#
# NOTE: Because .common.mk is included in the Makefile before your definitions, your
# definitions APPEND dependencies and/or recipes.
#
# In contrast, the *-default targets are designed to be OVERRIDDEN. They
# are declared below with a single ":", so that a new definition in a Makefile
# OVERRIDES them, instead of adding additional dependencies and/or recipes
# to run. A common usage is to disable a task. For example, if there are no
# unit tests in the project, then unit-tests-default will fail, because of how
# it is defined below. (This isn't true for ruff, black, pylint, and ty, which
# silently ignore when there is no python code.) In this case, the Makefile
# should use this idiom:
#
#   unit-tests-default:  # note the single ":"!
#     @echo "${skip-default-target-message}"
#     @true
#
# The "skip-default-target-message" variable is defined in .common.mk to provide a useful
# notice to the reader that the target is skipped.
#
# Using a single colon, ":", vs. two, "::", is essential. Using two colons would
# add dependencies or recipes, not replace them. However, because the *-default
# targets are defined below with one colon, if you use two colons, it triggers a
# make error. One or two has to be used consistently for all target definitions.
# Note that a warning will be issued when make detects a target override. These
# are harmless, although "noisy".
